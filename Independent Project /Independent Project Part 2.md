# The Consequences of Ocean Acidification for the Shark Population 

## Biological Question

How do elevated CO2 levels affect the blood chemistry, absolute lateralization, and total swimming time of elasmobranch fishes? Is there an obvious outcome difference between male and female sharks?

## Context (Introduction)

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution there has been a gradual growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration. But from 1950 onward there has been a sharp rise in CO2 due to the burning of fossil fuels and other anthropogenic activities. (Angus, I) Currently the global average is measured to be at 407 ppm, but according to the RCP8.5 high emission scenario the CO2 concentration could reach 990 ppm by 2100. (Green, Leon) The complication that arises from this initial problem is ocean acidification. When CO2 reacts with sea water it releases hydrogen ions which compete with marine organisms for carbonate and this intereferes with the growth of coral and plankton and interrupts major food webs. A research question that has not been studied enough is, could the increased water pCO2 induce physiological and behavioral effects in larger marine life? 

Previous studies have shown that teleost fishes show different magnitudes of behavioural disturbances when exposed to elevated CO2 levels. The data set chosen for furthur anaylsis focuses on the possible affects of ocean acidification on elasmobranchs specifically. Because shark populations are already declining globally this increased risk could cause complete shark species extinction. I will be repeating the analysis the original paper investigated and additionally I will be comparing male and female outcomes. 

## Methods 

This data set was obtained from the Dryad database: Green, Leon; Jutfelt, Fredrik; Green, L.; Jutfelt, F. (2014), Data from: Elevated carbon dioxide alters the plasma composition and behaviour of a shark, Dryad, Dataset,[https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6s713!] 
All of the measurements that were carried out existed in a single excel file, so 3 independent spreadsheets were created  titled "Blood Chemistry Data", "Lateralisation Data", and "Swimming Behavior Data". 
Describe the data you used to study your question and its origins. 


Give a description (one or two paragraphs) of how the data were produced.

The data set is 73kB and has character, integer, and numeric elements. 
Give a description of the size and nature of the data. Feel free to comment on any special challenges presented by any aspect of the data.

What the original authors did with the data:
Give about 1 - 2 paragraphs of explanation.  The scientists exposed 20 small-spotted sharks to either control (401 ppm) or high pCO2 (993 ppm) water treaments for 4 weeks and then examined both the biochemistry and demeanor of the sharks. The authors did not see compelling differences in a variety of categories such as growth, weight, mortality, and oxygen consumption. But the authors did see significant differences between the control and CO2 exposed sharks in plasma concentrations, the absolute lateralization parameter, swimming events and timing, and denticles size among females and males. They speculated that these changes could have a serious impact, even lethal, on the future health of these sharks. The increase in continuous swimming could be a result of a major neurological problem and if the ocean continues to be our dumping ground for CO2 it could lead to the extinction of elasmobranchs. 

What YOU did with the data and how you did it:
Verbally describe what your approach was and how you achieved it. You don't need to include code here; rather, the goal is to give the reader an idea of what your code does and why and how it does it. Don't give the results here, though. Throughout this section, strive to be crystal clear about which things the original authors did and which things you did. Saying "this study" is ambiguous in that regard, so make it clear.
I decided to repeat an analysis the original paper discussed. First, I wanted to provide a visualization that revealed how atmospheric CO2 levels were continuing to rise at am alarming rate and showed no signs of slowing down. 

This graph was created using the data from NASA, Vital Signs of the Planet Measyred at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis successfully showed that ocean acidification increases the presence of hydrogen ions and therefore we see an increase in HCO3- in the sharks blood. 

What did you find? How does this relate to your question? Include at least one visualization.
