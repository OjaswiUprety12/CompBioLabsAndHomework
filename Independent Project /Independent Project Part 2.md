# The Consequences of Ocean Acidification for the Shark Population 

## Biological Question

How do elevated CO2 levels affect the blood chemistry, absolute lateralization, and total swimming time of elasmobranch fishes? Is there an obvious outcome difference between male and female sharks?

## Introduction

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution there has been a gradual growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration. But from 1950 onward there has been a sharp rise in CO2 due to the burning of fossil fuels and other anthropogenic activities. (Angus, 2016) Currently the global average is measured to be at 407 ppm, but according to the RCP8.5 high emission scenario the CO2 concentration could reach 990 ppm by 2100. (Green and Jutfelt, 2014) The complication that arises from this initial problem is ocean acidification. When CO2 reacts with sea water it releases hydrogen ions which compete with marine organisms for carbonate and this intereferes with the growth of coral and plankton and interrupts major food webs. (Angus, 2016) A research question that has not been studied enough is, could the increased water pCO2 induce physiological and behavioral effects in larger marine life? 

Previous studies have shown that teleost fishes show different magnitudes of behavioural disturbances when exposed to elevated CO2 levels. (Green and Jutfelt, 2014) The data set chosen for furthur anaylsis focuses on the possible affects of ocean acidification on elasmobranchs specifically. Because shark populations are already declining globally this increased risk could cause complete shark species extinction. I will be repeating the analysis that Leon Green and Fredrik Jutfelt investigated and additionally I will be comparing male and female outcomes. 

## Methods 

**Source of Data**: 
This data set was obtained from the Dryad Database: 
Green, Leon; Jutfelt, Fredrik; Green, L.; Jutfelt, F. (2014), Data from: Elevated carbon dioxide alters the plasma composition and behaviour of a shark, Dryad, Dataset,[https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6s713!] 
All of the measurements that were carried out existed in a single excel file, so 3 independent spreadsheets were created titled "Blood Chemistry Data", "Lateralisation Data", and "Swimming Behavior Data". These are the three parameters of data I am interested in. 

**How the Data was Produced**: 
The scientists measured the pCO2 of the water using IR absorbance. The swimming pattern was filmed over night using IR light and IR cameras and then behavior parameters were calculated and statistically analyzed. Blood pH was analyzed after collection via venepuncture and plasma was also tested for total CO2. Plasma concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl- were measured using an ion radiometer biosensor. Lateralization was measured using a double T-maze method to check cognitive ability. The sharks were then returned to the public aquarium from which they were borrowed. 

**About the Data**: 
The data set is 73kB and has character, integer, and numeric elements. Inconsistencies in the data file include an entire row missing in the "Swimming Behavior Data" file which had to be disregarded. Columns with "unsexed" listed as the sex were removed to do an accurate analysis of female vs male. 

**What the Original Authors did with the Data**: 
The scientists exposed 20 small-spotted sharks to either control (401 ppm) or high pCO2 (993 ppm) water treaments for 4 weeks and then examined both the biochemistry and demeanor of the sharks. The authors did not see compelling differences in a variety of categories such as growth, weight, mortality, and oxygen consumption. But the authors did see significant differences between the control and CO2 exposed sharks in plasma concentrations, the absolute lateralization, swimming events and timing, and denticles size among females and males. They speculated that these changes could have a serious impact, even lethal, on the future health of these sharks. The increase in continuous swimming could be a result of a major neurological problem and if the ocean continues to be our dumping ground for CO2 it could lead to the extinction of elasmobranchs. 

**My Approach to the Data**: 
I decided to repeat an analysis the original paper discussed. First, I wanted to provide a visualization that revealed how atmospheric CO2 levels were continuing to rise at an alarming rate and showed no signs of slowing down. The image below was created using the data from NASA, Vital Signs of the Planet Measyred at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii.

Next, I wanted to show that the increase of atmospheric CO2 was increasing the HCO3- levels in the sharks, which can be seen by the box plot created below. Bicarbonate is an important regulator of pH and the authors cited that the behavioural shift of the sharks was due to this change in plasma concentration.

The authors discovered that the CO2-exposed animals experienced a longer swimming time, but they did not compare how the times differed among males and females. I created a graph to see if there was an obvious difference between the 2 sexes. In the plot below it can be seen that both sexes experience almost identical levels but control females experience slightly longer swimming times and CO2 exposed females experience shorter swiming times and vice versa for the males.

The last behavioural change the authors noticed was that the absolute lateralization was different between the treatment groups. The graph below shows that in CO2 exposed sharks there was increased absolute lateralization which indicates a change in swimming pattern. But the authors also propose this change could be due to the sharks searching for better water quality.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis successfully showed that ocean acidification increases the presence of hydrogen ions and therefore we see an increase in HCO3- in the sharks blood. Graphs were created to show the distribution of Cl- and Na+ concentration in the CO2 exposed sharks vs the control group. The plots show that among the control sharks concentrations tend to stay lower with a few outliers while the CO2 exposed sharks fall under increasingly high concentrations. These increases in electrolyte levels can lead to further medical complications in the shark population.

The average swimming times for CO2 exposed males and females vs control males and females were calculated. These were the results: 
Control Female= 2104 seconds 
CO2 Female= 1869 seconds 
Control Male= 1603 seconds 
CO2 Male= 1646 seconds.
There was not a significant difference observed and more data would need to obtained to claim that there was a bias towards either male or female. 
Both the control and CO2 exposed sharks showed asymmetric behaviour, favoring one side. But it was discovered that absolute lateralization was greater in the CO2 exposed sharks and they were turning more which could lead to more behavioral problems such as increased hyperactivity.
