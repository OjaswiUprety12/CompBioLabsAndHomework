# The Consequences of Ocean Acidification for the Shark Population 

## Biological Question

How do elevated CO2 levels affect the blood chemistry, absolute lateralization, and total swimming time of elasmobranch fishes? Is there an obvious outcome difference between male and female sharks?

## Context (Introduction)

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution there has been a gradual growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration. But from 1950 onward there has been a sharp rise in CO2 due to the burning of fossil fuels and other anthropogenic activities. (Angus, I) Currently the global average is measured to be at 407 ppm, but according to the RCP8.5 high emission scenario the CO2 concentration could reach 990 ppm by 2100. (Green, Leon) The complication that arises from this initial problem is ocean acidification. When CO2 reacts with sea water it releases hydrogen ions which compete with marine organisms for carbonate and this intereferes with the growth of coral and plankton and interrupts major food webs. A research question that has not been studied enough is, could the increased water pCO2 induce physiological and behavioral effects in larger marine life? 

Previous studies have shown that teleost fishes show different magnitudes of behavioural disturbances when exposed to elevated CO2 levels. The data set chosen for furthur anaylsis focuses on the possible affects of ocean acidification on elasmobranchs specifically. Because shark populations are already declining globally this increased risk could cause complete shark species extinction. I will be repeating the analysis the original paper investigated and additionally I will be comparing male and female outcomes. 

## Methods 

The source of the data: This data 
Describe the data you used to study your question and its origins. (Give FULL citations with working hyperlinks for the original publication AND the data package, if applicable).

Give a description (one or two paragraphs) of how the data were produced.

Give a description of the size and nature of the data. Feel free to comment on any special challenges presented by any aspect of the data.

What the original authors did with the data:
Give about 1 - 2 paragraphs of explanation.  The scientists exposed 

What YOU did with the data and how you did it:
Verbally describe what your approach was and how you achieved it. You don't need to include code here; rather, the goal is to give the reader an idea of what your code does and why and how it does it. Don't give the results here, though. Throughout this section, strive to be crystal clear about which things the original authors did and which things you did. Saying "this study" is ambiguous in that regard, so make it clear.
