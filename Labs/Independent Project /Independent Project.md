# The Consequences of Ocean Acidification for the Shark Population  

## Introduction 

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution there has been a gradual growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration. From 1950 onward there has been a sharp rise in CO2 due to the burning of fossil fuels and other anthropogenic activities. Currently the global average is measured to be at 407 ppm, but according to the RCP8.5 high emission scenario the CO2 concentration could reach 990 ppm by 2100. The complication that arises from this initial problem is ocean acidification. When CO2 reacts with sea water it releases hydrogen ions which compete with marine organisms for carbonate and this intereferes with the growth of coral and plankton. A research question that has not been studied enough is, could the increased water pCO2 induce physiological and behavioral effects in larger marine life? 

Previous studies have shown that teleost fishes show different magnitudes of behavioural disturbances when exposed to elevated CO2 levels. The data set chosen for furthur anaylsis focuses on the possible affects of ocean acidification on elasmobranchs specifically. Because shark populations are already declining globally this increased risk could cause complete shark species extinction. My driving questions(s) for this project are: How do elevated CO2 levels affect the blood chemistry, absolute lateralization, and total swimming time of elasmobranch fishes? Is there an obvious outcome difference between male and female sharks?

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed 

In this study it will be demonstrated that increased pCO2 levels decrease the amount of carbonate in the ocean and increase the presence of bicarbonate in the blood. The differences and similarities between nocturnal swimming patterns, either many starts and stops or a transition to more continuous swimming between the treatment groups, will be displayed. There will be an investigation of the connection between an increase in plasma concentration and stress signaling levels. Also, a comparison of female and male outcomes for absolute lateralization results will be conducted to recognize if there is presence of bias. Finally a model will be created to hypothesize the possible increase of hyperactivity of the shark population in the year 2100. 


## Goals of the Original study 

The goals of the original study were to examine the physiological and behavioural changes in small spotted catsharks after exposure to high pCO2 levels. The authors did not see compelling differences in a variety of categories such as growth, weight, mortality, and oxygen consumption. The authors did see a significant differences between the control and CO2 exposed sharks in plasma concentrations, the absolute lateralization, swimming events and timing, and denticles size among females and males. They speculated that these changes could have a serious impact, even lethal, on the future health of these sharks. The increase in continuous swimming could be a result of a major neurological problem and if the ocean continues to be our dumping ground for CO2 it could lead to the extinction of elasmobranchs. 

## Methodology 

The scientists exposed 20 small-spotted sharks to either control (401 ppm) or high pCO2 (993uatm) water treatments for 4 weeks and then examined both the biochemistry and demeanor of the sharks. The water pCO2 was measured using IR absorbance. The swimming pattern was filmed over night using IR light and IR cameras and then behavior parameters were calculated and statistically analyzed. Blood pH was analyzed immediately after collection via venepuncture and plasma was also tested for total CO2. Plasma concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl- were measured using an ion radiometer biosensor. Lateralization was measured using a double T-maze method to check cognitive ability. The sharks were then returned to the public aquarium from which they were borrowed. 

## About the Data

The data set is encompassed in a single excel spreadsheet. It consists of character, integer, and numeric elements. 

The data set is 73 kB. Blood chemistry data has 12 rows, swimming behavior data has 148 rows, and lateralization data has 17 rows. 

The raw data for all the studied parameters are on one excel sheet so it was split up and the relevent parameters were obtained. Inconsistencies in the data file include an entire row missing which had to be disregarded. Columns with "unsexed" listed as the gender was removed to do an accurate analysis of female vs male. 


## Detailed Description of Analysis 

First, we will create a graph using data from NASA about the relentless rise of atmospheric CO2 to show the annual trends from the early 2000s. We expect to see an increase in HCO3- which is an important regulator of pH. Using the bar geom we will be able to compare the various outcomes in blood chemistry, specfically the concentrations of Na+ and Cl- because these ions have a strong correlation with neural stress pathways. Using the line geom we will be able to track the changes, seen over a span of a month, in altered swimming behavior. Specifically we want to look at how many turns vs continous swimming the different treatment groups engage in. We want to see if female or male sharks are more susceptible to this change in lifestyle and what that means for their potential prey and predators. Finally, a function similar to a logistic growth model, will be designed to show the rate at which the shark populations physiology will continue to change if the planetary boundary of climate change is surpassed.
