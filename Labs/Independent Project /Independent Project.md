# The Consequences of Ocean Acidification for the Shark Population  

## Introduction 

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution there has been a gradual growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration. From 1950 onward there has been a sharp rise in CO2 due to the burning of fossil fuels and other anthropogenic activities. Currently the global average is measured to be at 407 ppm, but according to the RCP8.5 high emission scenario the CO2 concentration could reach 990 ppm by 2100. The complication that arises from this initial problem is ocean acidification. When CO2 reacts with sea water it releases hydrogen ions which compete with marine organisms for carbonate and this intereferes with the growth of coral and plankton. A research question that has not been studied enough is, could the increased water pCO2 induce physiological and behavioral effects in larger marine life? 

Previous studies have shown that teleost fishes show different magnitudes of behavioural disturbances when exposed to elevated CO2 levels. The data set chosen for furthur anaylsis focuses on the possible affects of ocean acidification on elasmobranchs specifically. Because shark populations are already declining globally this increased risk could cause complete shark species extinction. My driving questions(s) for this project are: How do elevated CO2 levels affect the blood chemistry, absolute lateralization, and total swimming time of elasmobranch fishes? Is there an obvious outcome difference between male and female sharks. 

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed 

In this study it will be demonstrated that increased pCO2 levels decrease the amount of carbonate in the ocean and increase the persence of bicarbonate in the blood. The differences and similarities between nocturnal swimming patterns either many starts and stops or a transition to more continuous swimming between the treatment groups will be displayed. There will be an investigation of the connection between an increase in plasma concentration and stress signaling levels. Also, a comparison of female and male outcomes for absolute lateralization results will be conducted to recognize if there is presence of bias. Finally a model will be created to hypothesize the possible increased levels of hyperactivity of the shark population in the year 2100. 

Blood plasma values are provided in table 1. The noteable results were that HCO3- levels were significantly different between the control and CO2 exposed sharks and plasma Na+ concentrations were elevated in the CO2 treatment. The increase in plasma Na+ and HCO3- concentrations show that the same mechanism is responsible for pH regulation under near future CO2 levels and that the ion concentrations remain altered after long-term exposure. Plasma ion levels could be within the tolerance range but sub-lethal long term impacts are unknown. There were factors such as the sharks weight-length relationship, growth, oxygen consumption, denticle size, and mortality that did not differ significantly. The absolute lateralization was significantly different among the control and CO2 exposed sharks. Where absolute means the strength of the directional turning. Higher degree in absoute could mean higher escape reactivity so larger fish including sharks are potential predators. The CO2 exposed group expressed a longer swimming time per swimming event. Control sharks showed a nocturnal swimming pattern characterzied by many starts and stops, where the CO2 exposed sharks showed more continuous increased lateralization. 

## Goals of the Original study 

The goals of the original study were to study the physiological and behavioural

## Methodology 

The scientists exposed sharks to either control or high pCO2 water treatments for 4 weeks and then examined both the behavior and physiology of the sharks. 20 small- spotted catsharks were exposed to either control pCO2 (401 uatm) or high pCO2 (993uatm) conditions for 1 month prior to behavioural and physiological testing. The water pCO2 was measured using IR absorbance. The swimming pattern was filmed over night using IR light and IR cameras. Blood pH was analyzed immediately after collection via venepuncture and plasma was also analysed for total CO2. Plasma concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl- were measured using an ion radiometer biosensor. The sharks were returned to the public aquarium from which they were borrowed. 

## Type of data in this data set:

### Format of data 

### Size of data(i.e., megabytes, lines, etc) The data set is 73 kB. 

### Any inconsistencies in the data files? Anything that looks problematic? The raw data for all the studied parameters are on one excel sheet. 

### What the data represent about the biology? Or this could be covered before.
