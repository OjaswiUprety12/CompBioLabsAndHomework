# Ocean Acidfication Consequences for the Shark Population  

## Introduction 
Write a paragraph or two to set the stage and define the overall objectives. 

There has been a relentless rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration since the industrial revolution and it is predicted to reach 940uatm by 2100 according to the RCP8.5 high emission scenario.(cite)  The burning of fossil fuels has increased the pCO2 of the ocean surface waters, a process known as ocean acidification. Previous studies have shown that teleost fishes show behavioural disturbances when exposed to elevated CO2 levels. This study focuses on the possible effects of ocean acidification on elasmobranchs. Because shark populations are already declining globally this increased risk could cause complete shark species extinction. 

The introduction should end with statement of question, like, "My driving questions(s) for this project is how do elevated CO2 levels affect x,y, and z? 

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed 

## Goals of original study that produced the data 1 paragraph 

## Brief description of methodology that produced the data 
The scientists exposed sharks to either control or high pCO2 water treatments for 4 weeks and then examined both the behavior and physiology of the sharks. 

## Type of data in this data set:

### Format of data 

### Size of data(i.e., megabytes, lines, etc) The data set is 73 kB. 

### Any inconsistencies in the data files? Anything that looks problematic?

### What the data represent about the biology? Or this could be covered before. 

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved 
the steps proposed here should have an obvious correspondence to the driving question(s) listed above.
