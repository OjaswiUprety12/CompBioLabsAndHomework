## Discrete-Time Logistic Growth Model Script 

### This model is used to predict the population abundance from generation to generation:
Abundance [t] = Abundance [t - 1] + ( r * Abundance [t -1] * (K - Abundance [t - 1) / K  )

**Abundance[t]** represents the abundance of the population at time t
**r** represents the intrinsic growth rate of the population 
 **K** represents the environmental carrying capacity for the population 

## A function was created: "TimeLogisticGrowthModel" that contains r, K, Abundance, and NumberOfGen as its arguements. 
## Code was added to the function so that it produces a plot of the data it generates. A graph of Time vs Abundance should be displayed. 
## Additional code was added to write the data set into an excel file into the directory of your choice.
